# Graph Spectral Alignment
This repository contains the matlab implementation of the graph spectral alignment originally proposed in "FOCUSR: Feature Oriented Correspondence using Spectral Regularization - A Method for Precise Surface Matching", by Lombaert, H. et. al., published in PAMI 2013.

We perform this graph spectral alignment in our work "Graph Convolutions on Spectral Embeddings for Cortical Surface Parcellation", published in Medical Image Analysis, January 2019. 

### Contributions of the work
The novel spectral alignment enables a direct learning of surface data across compatible surface bases.
